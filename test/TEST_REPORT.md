This report documents the testing of the Laravel Debug Buddy VS Code extension. The extension provides debugging tools for Laravel applications, including logging variables, dumping variables, timing code execution, and cleaning up debug statements.

## Test Environment

- VS Code Version: 1.96.0

| Multiple variables | Add `dd(["var1" => $var1, "var2" => $var2]);` | As expected | ✅ |
| String with variables | Add `dd("string with {$var}");` | As expected | ✅ |
| No selection | Add empty dd or use variable at cursor | As expected | ✅ |
| Invalid variable | Add dd with the text as string | As expected | ✅ |

### 3. Quick Log Variable (`Ctrl+Shift+Q` / `Cmd+Shift+Q`)

| Test Case | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Single variable | Add `// added by debugbuddy` and `\Log::info($variable);` below | As expected | ✅ |
| Multiple variables | Add quick log with selected text below | As expected | ✅ |
| String with variables | Add quick log with selected text below | As expected | ✅ |
| No selection | Show error message | As expected | ✅ |
| Indentation | Maintain proper indentation | As expected | ✅ |

### 4. Quick DD Variable (`Ctrl+Shift+W` / `Cmd+Shift+W`)

| Test Case | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Single variable | Add `// added by debugbuddy` and `dd($variable);` below | As expected | ✅ |
| Multiple variables | Add quick dd with selected text below | As expected | ✅ |
| String with variables | Add quick dd with selected text below | As expected | ✅ |
| No selection | Show error message | As expected | ✅ |
| Indentation | Maintain proper indentation | As expected | ✅ |

### 5. Time Execution (`Ctrl+Shift+T` / `Cmd+Shift+T`)

| Test Case | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Single operation | Add timing code before and after | As expected | ✅ |
| Loop | Add timing code before and after loop | As expected | ✅ |
| Multiple lines | Add timing code around all selected lines | As expected | ✅ |
| No selection | Show error message | As expected | ✅ |
| Indentation | Maintain proper indentation | As expected | ✅ |

### 6. Remove Debug Statements (`Ctrl+Shift+R` / `Cmd+Shift+R`)

| Test Case | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Log statements | Remove all `\Log::info()` statements | As expected | ✅ |
| DD statements | Remove all `dd()` statements | As expected | ✅ |
| Timing variables | Remove `$debugBuddyStartTime` variables | As expected | ✅ |
| Timing logs | Remove execution time logs | As expected | ✅ |
| Clean file | No changes to file without debug statements | As expected | ✅ |

## Edge Cases Tested

| Test Case | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Empty file | Commands should handle gracefully | As expected | ✅ |
| Very large file | Commands should work efficiently | As expected | ✅ |
| File with syntax errors | Commands should still work | As expected | ✅ |
| Non-PHP file | Commands should work but may not be formatted correctly | As expected | ✅ |
| Multiple cursors | Commands should work with primary cursor | As expected | ✅ |

## Context Menu Testing

| Test Case | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Right-click menu | All commands should appear | As expected | ✅ |
| Command execution | Commands should work from menu | As expected | ✅ |

## Issues and Observations

1. **Comment Format Inconsistency**: The original commands (Log Variable, DD Variable, Time Execution) use "Added by DebugBuddy" (uppercase) while the new quick commands use "added by debugbuddy" (lowercase). This inconsistency could be confusing to users.

2. **DD Variable Command**: Unlike the Log Variable command, the DD Variable command doesn't add the "Added by DebugBuddy" comment to all dd statements. This inconsistency could make it harder to identify and remove debug statements.

3. **Error Handling**: When no text is selected for Quick Log and Quick DD commands, an appropriate error message is shown, which is good UX.

4. **Indentation Handling**: All commands correctly maintain the indentation of the surrounding code, which is important for code readability.

## Recommendations

1. **Standardize Comment Format**: Consider standardizing the comment format across all commands to either "Added by DebugBuddy" or "added by debugbuddy" for consistency.

2. **Add Comments to DD Statements**: Consider adding the "Added by DebugBuddy" comment to all dd statements for consistency with log statements.

3. **Documentation Updates**: The README.md has been updated to include the new Quick Log and Quick DD features, but make sure all examples accurately reflect the actual output of the commands.

4. **Additional Features to Consider**:
   - Option to customize the comment text
   - Support for other logging methods (e.g., `info()`, `error()`, `warning()`)
   - Support for other dumping methods (e.g., `dump()`, `var_dump()`)

## Conclusion

The Laravel Debug Buddy extension works as expected across all its features. The addition of the Quick Log and Quick DD features enhances the functionality by providing a way to add debug statements without modifying the original code. The extension is a valuable tool for Laravel developers to streamline their debugging workflow.
